                <h1>Introduction to Data Science</h1>
                <p>
                    Data science is all about using data to solve problems. The problem could be decision making such as identifying which email is spam and which is not. Or a product recommendation such as which movie to watch? Or predicting the outcome such as who will be the next President of the USA? So, the core job of a data scientist is to understand the data, extract useful information out of it and apply this in solving the problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Data Science Life Cycle</h4><br/>
                    <b>Step 1: Define Problem Statement</b><br/>
                    Creating a well-defined problem statement is a first and critical step in data science. It is a brief description of the problem that you are going to solve.
                    But why do we need a well-defined problem statement?
                    A problem well defined is a problem half-solved.
                    — Charles Kettering
                    Also, all the efforts and work you do after defining the problem statement is to solve it. The problem statement is shared by your client. Your client can be your boss, colleague or it can be your personal project. They would tell you the problems they are facing. Some examples are shown below.
                    I want to increase the revenues
                    I want to predict the loan default for my credit department,
                    I want to recommend the job to my clients
                    Most of the times, these initial set of a problem shared with you is vague and ambiguous. For example, the problem statement: “I want to increase the revenue”, doesn’t tell you how much to increase the revenue such as 20% or 30%, for which products to increase revenue and what is the time frame to increase the revenue. You have to make the problem statement clear, goal-oriented and measurable. This can be achieved by asking the right set of questions.
                    “Getting the right question is the key to getting the right answer.”
                    – Jeff Bezos
                    How can you ask better or right questions to create a well-defined problem statement? You should ask open-ended rather than closed-ended questions. The open-ended questions help to uncover unknown unknowns. The unknown unknowns are the things which you don’t know you don’t know.

                    We will work on a problem statement “Which club will win the EPL?”<br/>
                    <b>Step 2: Data Collection</b><br/>
                    You need to collect the data which can help to solve the problem. Data collection is a systematic approach to gather relevant information from a variety of sources. Depending on the problem statement, the data collection method is broadly classified into two categories.
                    First, when you have some unique problem and no related research is done on the subject. Then, you need to collect new data. This method is called as primary data collection. For example, you want information on the average time that employees spend in a cafeteria across companies. There is no public data available of these. But you can collect the data through various methods such as surveys, interviews of employees and by monitoring the time spent by employees in cafeteria. This method is time-consuming.
                    Another method is to use the data which is readily available or collected by someone else. These data can be found on the internet, news articles, government census, magazines and so on. This method is called as secondary data collection. This method is less time-consuming than the primary method.
                    For our problem statement on EPL. You can collect and aggregate the data from various open-source websites such as Github, Kaggle, and datahub.

                    <b>Step 3: Data Quality Check and Remediation</b><br/>
                    One of the most important and often ignored aspects by data scientists is ensuring the data that is used for analysis and interpretation is of good quality.
                    After collecting the data, most people start the analysis on it. Often, they forgot to do a sanity check on the data. If the data is of bad quality, it can give misleading information. Simply said: “Garbage in, garbage Out”.
                    Image for post
                    For example, if you start the analysis without ensuring data quality. Then you might get unexpected results such as the Crystal Palace club will win the next EPL. However, your domain knowledge on EPL says that the result looks inaccurate as Crystal Palace has never even finished in the top 4.
                    <br/><b>Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis</b><br/>
                    Before you model the steps to arrive at a solution, it’s important to analyse the data. It is the most exciting step as it helps you to build familiarity with the data and extract useful insights. If you skip this step then you might end up generating inaccurate models and choosing the insignificant variables in your model.
                    As quoted by John Tukey, developer of Exploratory Data Analysis,
                    “It is important to understand what you CAN DO before you learn to measure how WELL you seem to have DONE it.”
                    But it can be strenuous and difficult. Are there tools or techniques to explore data in a meaningful way?
                    Yes, you can use descriptive statistics such as central value measures and variability measures. Also, visualisation methods such as graphs and plots can be used for analysis.
                    For example, you can calculate the average goals scored per match. You can also check if home advantage is a real thing?
                    The bar chart below shows the home advantage of Liverpool. It shows that of all home matches of Liverpool, they have won 17 and drawn 2. But have never lost any home match.

                    Chart 1: Home Advantage for Liverpool [1]
                    However, there is no home advantage of Leicester. It shows that of all home matches of Leicester, they have won 8, lost 8 and drawn 3.

                    Data analysis is an iterative process that helps you to get closer to the solution. Every iteration has a cost associated with it. Therefore, it is advisable that as a data scientist you plan properly so that the number of iterations is reduced. You can play with data, create your own graphs and learn to derive inferences. All these analyses which you performed are commonly known as exploratory data analysis (EDA).
                    <br/><b>Step 5: Data Modelling</b><br/>
                    Modelling means formulating every step and gather the techniques required to achieve the solution. You need to list down the flow of the calculations which is nothing but modelling steps to the solution. The important factor is how to perform the calculations. There are various techniques under Statistics and Machine Learning that you can choose based on the requirement.
                    For EPL data, we chose to use statistical techniques to predict the winner in the current season.

                    <br/>
                    Top 6 teams<br/>
                    As per the data of the last three seasons, we have learnt that the winner of EPL is changing but the top 6 clubs remain the same. These clubs are Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. The winner in the next season is very likely to be from these top 6 teams.

                    <b>Step 6: Data Communication</b><br/>

                    This is the final step where you present the results from your analysis to the stakeholders. You explain to them how you came to a specific conclusion and your critical findings.
                    Most often you need to present your findings to a non-technical audience, such as the marketing team or business executives. You need to communicate the results in a simple to understand manner. And the stakeholders should be able to chalk out an actionable plan from it.
                    But what are the important things you need to keep in mind while communicating your results?
                    Know your audience and speak their language
                    You should know your audience and speak their language. For example, you are presenting the prediction of EPL winner to a football fan. They do not understand the statistics you have used but they can relate to the steps you followed to decide the winner.
                    2. Focus on values and outcomes
                    You should focus on value and outcomes. Your stakeholder would not be interested in how you got the data but from where you got the data. The usage of credible sources helps to build confidence in your prediction.
                    3. Communicate assumptions and limitations
                    You should clearly communicate the important assumptions and limitations you have made. For example, to calculate the overall rating of the team you have assumed 3–4–3–1 formation for all the teams. It’s important that you communicate these to the stakeholders.
                    Although the goal is to predict the winner, there might be some other critical findings that are relevant. For example, the teams with the best attack, midfield, defence and goalkeeping. The best player for each position in the league based on the players’ skills. Such a unified view of the data in the form of graphs, charts and numbers is called a Dashboard. you can use Excel to create the dashboard.
