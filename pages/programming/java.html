						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>
							Java is a modern, evolutionary computing language that combines an elegant
							language design with powerful features that were previously available primarily in
							specialty languages. In addition to the core language components, Java software
							distributions include many powerful, supporting software libraries for tasks such
							as database, network, and graphical user interface (GUI) programming. In this
							section, we focus on the core Java language features.<br/>
							Java is a true object-oriented (OO) programming language. The main implication of
							this statement is that in order to write programs with Java, you must work within
							its object-oriented structure.<br/>
							Object-oriented languages provide a framework for designing programs that
							represent real-world entities such as cars, employees, insurance policies, and so
							on. Representing real-world entities with nonobject-oriented languages is difficult
							because it's necessary to describe entities such as a truck with rather primitive
							language constructs such as Pascal's record, C's struct, and others that represent
							data only.<br/>
							The behavior of an entity must be handled separately with language constructs
							such as procedures and/or functions, hence, the term procedural programming
							languages. Given this separation, the programmer must manually associate a data
							structure with the appropriate procedures that operate on, that is, manipulate, the
							data.

						<h2>java if, if...else and Nested if...else</h2>
						<p>In this article, you will learn to create decision making statements in a java program using different forms of if..else statement.
							There are three forms of if...else statements in java.
							<pre>
							1. if statement
								if(condition){
									statement;
								}
							2. if...else statement
								if(condition){
										statement;
									}
								else{
									statement;
								}
							3. if...else if...else statement
								if(condition){
										statement;
									}
								else if{
									statement;
								}
								else{
									statement;
								}
							</pre>
						</p>
						<h4>java Loop</h4>
						<p>
							In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.
							For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.
							That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.
							There are 3 types of loops in java.
							<pre>
							for loop
								for(initialization; condition; update){
									statement;
								}
							while loop
								initialization
								while(condition){
									statement;
									update;
								}
							do...while loop
								initialization
								do{
									statement
									update
								}while(condition);
							</pre>
						</p>

					<div class="tab-pane" id="methods">
						<p>A method is the object-oriented equivalent of a procedure in nonobject-oriented
							languages. That is, a method is a program construct that provides the mechanism
							(method) for performing some act, in this case, barking. Given an instance of some
							entity, we invoke behavior with a dot syntax that associates an instance with a
							method in the class definition:<br/>
							<pre>
								Method Invocation Syntax
								<instance>.<behavior>()
								<variable> = <instance>.<behavior>(<arguments>...)
							</pre>

						<p>
							Java provides several classes for managing sets or collections of data, for example,
							Vector (see java.util.Vector). And, of course, you can design your own
							classes.
							In addition, Java supports arrays. A Java array is different from a user-defined
							container object such as a Vector instance in the sense that Java provides built-in,
							language-level syntactic support for arrays, as do many other languages. Although
							language-level support for arrays increases the complexity of the language
							definition, it's justified (in the minds of most programmers) because array usage is
							entrenched in traditional programming.
							An array is a linear collection of data elements, each element directly accessible via
							its index. The first element has index 0; the last element has index n - 1. It has the
							form:

						<h2>classes and object</h2>
						<p>
							<h4>classes in Java</h4>
							A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
							A class can contain any of the following variable types.<br/>
							<b>Local variables</b> − Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.
							<br/><b>Instance variables</b> − Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.
							<br/><b>Class variables</b> − Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.
							A class can have any number of <a href="#methods" data-toggle="tab">methods</a> to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the above example, barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are methods.
							Following are some of the important topics that need to be discussed when looking into classes of the Java Language.
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Objects in Java</h4>
							Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.
							If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.
							If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.
							Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.
							So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.
